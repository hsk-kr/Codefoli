- **Domain Management**: Utilizes AWS Route 53 for intelligent domain routing.
- **Content Distribution**: Amazon CloudFront ensures fast, secure delivery of the website.
- **Website Hosting**: AWS S3 hosts the static website content, offering reliability and scalability.
- **Authentication**: Amazon Cognito User Pools are integrated for secure user authentication.
- **Backend Integration**: AWS API Gateway handles backend integration, enabling dynamic content and functionality.
- **Serverless Functions**: AWS Lambda is used for invocations from API Gateway and performing database operations, ensuring a flexible and efficient backend.
- **User Profile Deployment**: An SQS queue, along with an EC2 instance, manages the deployment of user profiles to individually created buckets. This architecture supports both flexibility and isolation of user data.
