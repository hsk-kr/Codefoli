- Mode buttons configured mostly for custom domains
- Architecture designed for custom domains on backend as such:
    - deploy send lambda function is used as well for this, and it checks
      if this certificate exists already if so for now denies it
    - Sends the message to deployment queue, which is polled by the ec2 instance, which checks if it is a custom domain request
      and if so, it creates the SSL certificate, as well as the Cloudfront distribution,
      and adds to the custom domain sqs queue a mapping between the domain name, distribution id and the ssl id
      in a message.
    - poller is the same ec2 instance but a different process, which polls the custom domain sqs queue, and if it finds a message,
      it checks if the ssl certificate is valid yet, if so, it sets the cname domain value as the domain name, and
      the ssl certificate value as the ssl certificate. It then invalidates the cloudfront distribution cache
        and then adds the domain name to the database, and then deletes the message from the queue.
